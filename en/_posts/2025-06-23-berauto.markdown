  [BerAuto](https://github.com/barnabas47/BerAuto) is a modern car rental system with a .NET 9 (ASP.NET Core) backend and React + TypeScript frontend. The goal is to create a realistic, multi-role (customer, employee, admin) car rental platform.

  **Main features:**
  - List/filter cars, manage categories
  - User registration, login, role-based access (JWT)
  - Place rental requests, manage rentals (customer, employee, admin views)
  - Admin: manage cars, categories, users, permissions
  - Employee panel: approve/reject rentals, handover/return, invoice generation
  - Profile management, address management
  - Responsive, clean, black-white-purple UI

  **Technologies:**
  - Backend: ASP.NET Core 9, Entity Framework Core, REST API, JWT authentication
  - Frontend: React, TypeScript, React Router, Context API, modern CSS
  - Database: MSSQL (EF migrations, test data)
  - Other: Docker support, multi-level permissions, clean code structure

  **How to run:**
  - Backend: enter the BerAuto folder, start the ASP.NET Core server: `dotnet run` or F5 in Visual Studio
  - Frontend: enter the berauto-frontend folder, `npm install`, then `npm start` (http://localhost:3000)

  **User roles:**
  - Guest: browse cars, place rental requests
  - Customer: own rentals, profile, rental requests
  - Employee: manage rentals, handover/return, invoicing
  - Admin: full management of cars, categories, users, permissions

  **Developer info:**
  - Frontend and backend can run separately.
  - The project uses a responsive, clean UI.
  - Role management is based on Context API and JWT.
  - Backend REST APIs are documented and fully used by the frontend.
